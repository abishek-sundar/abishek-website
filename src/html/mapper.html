      <div class="projectHeadings">Voyager, The Ultimate Touristic Map</div>
      <div class="projectText">Here is a fully fledged functional map, catered to tourists. It includes features like
        searching for streets, points of interests, features, intersections and different cities. The map will also
        auto-complete your queries. You can even find out the shortest path to go from point A to point B and includes
        a directions UI. The map has a minimap in the bottom right corner that aids navigation and shows your location.<br />
        <br /></div>

          allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
      <div class="projectText">Some searching functionality and auto completion is showcased here. The auto-completion
        is inspired by command line and does so when the key "Tab" is pressed. The features (like parks, monuments
        etc.) will be suggested based on size i.e bigger features will be suggested first. </div><br />

      <div class="projectText">This is how our minimap works. You can click anywhere on it to directly be transported
        to that location. Anytime you are panning or zooming around the map, the red box indicates your location
        respective to the big features of the city. </div><br />

      <div class="projectText">Here is a demonstration of our directions user interface. You can search how to go from
        an intersection to another intersection or from an intersection to a point of interest. The map finds the
        closest point of interest to your intersection through pathfinding and is not just geographical. In the drop
        down, you can see navigation directions given to the user. You can scroll through these, just as you would in
        any software, with a scroll wheel. The drop down also collapses to the side if you wish to see something behind
        the navigation instructions so it doesn't hinder your experience. </div>
      <br />
      <div class="projectText"> We coded this map entirely in C++ using the OpenStreetMaps and EasyGL APIs. <br />Algorithms
        and data structures used:
        <ul>
          <li>Djikstra's algorithm</li>
          <li>A-star algorithm</li>
          <li>Variation of nearest neighbour</li>
          <li>2-opt</li>
          <li>Simulated annealing</li>
          <li>R-trees</li>
        </ul>
        We also tackled a variation of the travelling salesman problem.<br /> A UPS delivery truck has to drop off and
        pick up packages at various locations. The truck has to start and end at a depot. <br /><br />
        In order to optimise the time taken by the truck, we used a nearest neighbour algorithm that only went to valid
        locations. A location is deemed "valid" as long as we aren't required to drop-off something we have not picked
        up. With this inital path, we then used 2-opt and simulated annealing.<br />
        These algorithms were hard on the processor computationally and we had to harness the computational ability of
        multiple threads. Multithreading helped us cut our loading and computation times by 75%.
